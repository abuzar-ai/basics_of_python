print("2+3") #this is use for simple print like string 
print(2+3) 
print(2-3)
print(2*3)
print(2/3) #this is for float number when use single / 
print(12/2) 
print(12//2)#when use double tham its for interger //
print(12**3) #its used for exponential power like 12*3times
print(12%5) #this sign is used for remainder
#  python work on PEMDAS rule like paranthesis, exponent,multiplication, division, additiuon, subtraction
print(2**3/2*6-4*(3-4/2)) #this is the example of PEMDAS rule
